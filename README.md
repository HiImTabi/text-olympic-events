# Text-based Athletics Event Simulator
This is a very simple text-based athletics events simulator written in C++, created by myself and two other students in an object-oriented programming course in university.

In the program, you can create athletes in three disciplines: running, jumping, or throwing. You are free to make as many as you want. Their names and skill are randomly generated by the program. 

After the athletes are created, they can be trained by three randomly-generated trainers. Each trainer's effectiveness at training the athletes is based on the years of experience they have. Training can be done as much as the user desires.

After training, athletes in each discipline can compete against each other, with randomly-generated results based on their skill levels. Though athletes with higher skill levels are more likely to win, it's possible for the worst athlete to win.
